User Documentation: https://gldrawer.readthedocs.io

GLDrawer is a from scratch recreation of GDIDrawer using OpenGL3

Differences from GDIDrawer include:
- Higher performance and hardware acceleration
- Ability to use shapes as objects, even while on a canvas 
- Addition of sprites for easy use of image files as well as extra shape types
- Ability to easily embed a canvas into a windows forms application
- anti aliasing, mag mapping and min mapping
- scaling of shapes after their creation
- rotation of shapes
- Runtime rasterization of font files
- The addition of Gameobjects which allow for the use of world coordinates in the form of transforms
- Timing utilities such as delta times and on frame events
- Math utilities such a linearly interpolated motion
- Colliders with collision/point intersection detection (in progress
- particle engine with physics (in progress)
- Implementation and wrapper of the Box2D physics engine (in progress)
- velocity and motion tools
