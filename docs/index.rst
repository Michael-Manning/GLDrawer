Welcome to GLDrawer's documentation
=====================================
GLDrawer is a simple drawing and game engine which has been modeled closely after GDIDrawer.
It is can be used in nearly all the same ways as it's predecessor, but runs faster and has many more features.

More than a drawing library
*********************************
